# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers, such as age, class, fare, gender, and survival status. Through this analysis, we aim to extract meaningful insights and visualize key trends.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Statistical Summary and Missing Values Analysis
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Correlation Analysis
- Survival Rate Analysis based on various factors (e.g., gender, class, age)

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-eda.git
cd titanic-eda](https://github.com/Meesamraza512/Data-Analytics-Project/blob/57224e5483661fb895a628184f9c26ab75a9efdd/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20on%20a%20Titanic%20Dataset.ipynb)
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Exploratory Data Analysis on a Titanic Dataset.ipynb"
```
3. Run the notebook cells step by step to perform EDA.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be obtained from Kaggle or other sources.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations such as:
- Passenger distribution by class and gender
- Survival rate analysis
- Correlation heatmaps
- Boxplots for age and fare analysis

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the survival factors of Titanic passengers. It serves as a great starting point for learning **data analysis and visualization** techniques.
